	i)		The Wordcount task was implemented with NodeJS.
	ii)		fs, recursive-readdir,link and commander Node modules where used.
	iii)	fs is the default NodeJS file handling library.
	iv)		recursive-readdir is a simple Node module for recursively listing all files in a directory, or in any subdirectories.
	v)		link is the module used in order to create the custom command.
	vi)		commander is used in order to pass command line arguments to our controller.
	vii)	The main reason for selecting node is performance. Not only because of the lightning fast JavaScript execution, but mainly because of the event loop that is a single thread that performs all I/O operations asynchronously.

	i)		The user can enter a file location or directory with subdirectories and files and the application prints in the console the requested information.
	ii)		The application generates a log text file for each input file which it stores in the logs directory.
	iii)	The application ignores non-text files.
	iv)		The user can request a full report, a frequency report and a basic report (explained in the how-to-run.txt file).
	v)		If the user enters a directory with files and subdirectories, the application will recursively loop through them and find all the text files in order to create the appropreate reports.
